Ajax Client Tools
=================

A library of reusable tools that make building Ajax UIs for
JSON-based webservices simpler.

This library is likely to be of little use to anyone who can't control
the format of the JSON that comes from their services. It matches the
idioms I use on my projects. Particularly for the DataStore class. The
merge templating function would be more widely useful, as will the
PageManager.

It is provided open-source (under the MIT license) not because I think
it is terribly useful, but because I have no need to keep it
proprietary.

Minification
------------

I use the Google closure compiler for minification. My command line
(from within the repo) is:

$ java -jar ~/.local/jar/compiler.jar --js act.js --js_output_file act.min.js

Yours will depend where you put compiler.jar
